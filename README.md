# Intent Classification
This repository explores the task of classifying short written commands into 7 different classes. The data is taken from this  [repository](https://github.com/snipsco/nlu-benchmark/tree/master/2017-06-custom-intent-engines "repository").
In my first attempt, I have tried RNNs as my architecture and have achieved almost 99% accuracy on the validation and train data.  The architechture is shown in the picture below.

This is a work in progress, and I will explore other architectures too.
